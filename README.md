# Golf-Simulator
This code is part of an ongoing school project. The aim of this code is to create an app that can take movement data from a CSV file and a few known and requested values to generate an accurate image of the trajectory.
The code takes the movement data of the user's phone to act as a mock golf club. The user holds the phone and swings as if it were a golf club.
